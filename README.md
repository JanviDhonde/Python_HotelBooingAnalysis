## 🏨 Hotel Booking Data Analysis  

### 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover key insights about reservation trends, cancellation patterns, and customer behaviors. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, actionable suggestions for improving business performance are provided.  

### 🎯 Objective  
The goal of this project is to:  
- Identify trends in hotel reservations and cancellations.
